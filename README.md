# Take home assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the app:

```bash
npm run install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODOs if I would have more time
- add button to load more reviews or infinite scrolling in case we have too many reviews - in this way the app has server side rendered content on load and then on the client side displayed next reviews as the user scrolls
